Train option is only open to Nepali and Indians which run from Raxaul (India) and arrives in Sirsiya (Southern Nepal).
 
I understand planning could be stressful especially when you have to think about not one but two, three, or more locations. So, if you are looking for the best place to stay in Nepal you can check hotel prices and book it through trusted Agoda, or Booking.com
 
Lot of people mainly visit Nepal for hikes and treks and stay in Kathmandu for few days before and after their trip. Here is a suggestion, you can do while in the city, visit 7 UNESCO Heritage Sites Day Tour.
 
It is a landlocked country that offers spectacular mountain views for days and you could easily spend months or years here but I would say 15 days is the absolute minimum. PS: most trekking are 10+ days anyway so, might as well take add that sick leave in there and make it a two weeks holiday.
